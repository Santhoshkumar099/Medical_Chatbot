# ü©∫ Medical Chatbot ü§ñ  

This project is a **Streamlit web application** that uses **LangChain, FAISS, HuggingFace Embeddings, and Groq API** to build a medical chatbot.  
The chatbot reads a medical PDF, splits it into chunks, embeds it, and stores it in a vector database for **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**.

## üöÄ Features  

- Ask medical questions by typing OR selecting from a dropdown.  
- Retrieves the most relevant context from the medical PDF.  
- Displays detailed **token usage** (Prompt, Completion, Total, Cost).  
- Predefined sample questions for quick testing.

## üßë‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è Predefined Questions  

- What is the general prevention of Cold and flu?  
- What is First Aid and Emergency Care?  
- Tell about Future of Medicine AI and Healthcare?

## üõ† Technologies Used  

- Python 3.9+  
- Streamlit  
- LangChain  
- FAISS  
- HuggingFace Embeddings  
- Groq API

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works  

1. The medical PDF is pre-processed, split into chunks, and embedded using HuggingFace embeddings.  
2. The chunks are stored in **FAISS Vector Database** for efficient retrieval.  
3. When a question is asked, the chatbot retrieves the most relevant chunks.  
4. The retrieved context is passed to **Groq LLM** to generate the final answer.  
5. Token usage details are displayed in a collapsible dropdown.

## üí¨ How to Use  

1. Select a predefined question from the dropdown **OR** type your own question.  
2. The chatbot retrieves the relevant answer from the PDF.  
3. Expand the **Token Usage** dropdown to view detailed usage (Prompt tokens, Completion tokens, Total tokens, and Cost).
